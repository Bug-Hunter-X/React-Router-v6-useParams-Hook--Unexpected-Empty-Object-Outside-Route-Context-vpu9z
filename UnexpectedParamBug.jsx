In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's *not* directly a child of a route can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  The `useParams` hook relies on the routing context provided by its parent route component. If you attempt to access `useParams` outside this context, it will return an empty object, leading to potential bugs and unexpected rendering behavior. For example, consider a component nested several levels deep, attempting to extract parameters from a URL without being properly within the nested route structure.
